  Code 
  Purpose:    This code allows to hack into a Furby Connect Bluetooth Low Energy and control its behaviour. 
  
  References: The code is inspired by the GitHub repository BlueFluff: https://github.com/Jeija/bluefluff also 
              I am using the Arduino Bluetooth Low Energy Library: https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE
